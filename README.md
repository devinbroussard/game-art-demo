## 1. Goal of Application:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This application was made to demonstrate animations using Raylib. It is not a finished game. It was made by a group of two as a graded assignment to build teamwork skills. To open the application, download the zip file, extract it, and run the ".exe" file.

## 2. Game Controls:  
* **W:** Move the character up
* **A:** Move the character left
* **S:** Move the character down
* **D:** Move the character right
* **SPACE:** Attack
* **Z:** Increase character's scale (To meet assignment requirements)
* **X:** Decrease character's scale (To meet assignment requirements)
* **C:** Set character's scale back to normal (To meet assignment requirements)
* **E:** Make the character take damage over time
* **ESCAPE:** Close the application 

## 3. How to Grade:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short summary on how to grade each requirement:
* **Scaling:** By pressing the "Z", "X", and "C" keys, you can scale the main character.
* **Rotation:** Whenever any character takes damage, a heart on the health display will rotate and fade away.
* **Childing:** The health displays are childed to the character given to them in their constructor's argument list.

## 4. How to Play: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Download the latest release on github, and run the ".exe" file.
