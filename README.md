This application was made to demonstrate animations using Raylib. This project was made by a group of two as a graded assignment to build teamwork skills. To open the application, download the zip file, extract it, and run the ".exe" file.

## Game Controls:
* w > Move the character up
* a > Move the character left
* s > Move the character down
* d > Move the character right

To attack with your character
> Space bar.

The character in this trial can *not die* and so do not worry. Each enemy that is showed will only have 3 health. But has a cool down that you can attack them. Aswell there is a boundary that you can not leave.

The only goal is to show off the art and animations that were added.
